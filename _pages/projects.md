### Surface Urban Heat Islands 

![](/images/heat-island.png)

My research examines how land cover shapes urban heat islands in Boise, Phoenix, and Las Vegas using advanced spatial statistic models. I quantify vegetation and built-up areas, and apply GWR, STWR, and MGWR to analyze surface urban heat island patterns, biophysical indicators, and socioeconomic factors.

### Tickbase

As part of an NSF-funded project, I was the leader of the spatiotemporal modeling group and collaborated across disciplines to model tick-borne diseases using remote sensing data. My work processes 20 years of climate "big data," linking environmental factors to disease dynamics and developing a framework to manage large, complex ecological datasets in New England and specifically in Connecticut towns.

### Monitoring Iceplant with AI

[Project Website - NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/monitoring-invasive-iceplant-space)

In a NASA-funded project, I developed a diffusion-based super-resolution workflow to upscale 3-m imagery to 0.6 m for monitoring iceplant from space. Using a deep learning-based interactive labeling tool I built, we created high-accuracy training data, and improved U-Net architecture to map iceplant in the Dangermond Preserve (2020–2025). The next goal is mapping iceplant along the entire California coast.
