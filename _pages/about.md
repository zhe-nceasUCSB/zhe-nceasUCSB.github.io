Welcome! I am a postdoctoral scholar at the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS), University of California, Santa Barbara, where I work with Dr. Ben Halpern. As the lead researcher on the project “Monitoring the Invasive Iceplant from Space,” I focus on developing open and reproducible deep learning-based workflows to identify and monitor invasive iceplant species along the California coast.

My academic journey began with a bachelor’s degree in Remote Sensing in China, followed by two master’s degrees—one in Geographic Information Science (GIS) from Arizona State University and another in Computer Science from the University of Idaho. I completed my PhD in Geography at the University of Idaho, where I further honed my expertise in remote sensing and advanced computational methods.

As a remote sensing researcher, my primary focus lies in the application of deep learning techniques to earth observation data. My research interests span climate change, environmental challenges, geohealth, and spatiotemporal modeling. A central goal of my work is to create automated, deep learning-based workflows for remote sensing data analysis, with an emphasis on addressing the scarcity of annotated training data for artificial intelligence applications in this field.

In collaboration with Dr. Shoukun Sun, we developed Segmap, an interactive labeling tool for remote sensing data. Segmap integrates models fine-tuned with our preliminary remote sensing experiments, along with the original SAM model. The tool has been successfully applied to urban classification and invasive species mapping, and we continue to develop and enhance its functionality.

Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between AI innovation and real-world environmental monitoring, promoting reproducibility, transparency, and practical solutions for pressing ecological and geohealth issues.
